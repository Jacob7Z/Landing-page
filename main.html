            <h1>IBANEZ AZ</h1>
            <p>Taking adaptability to new extremes, the AZ series has established itself and carved out 
                a place that spans everything from the warmest blues licks, to the most intense, 
                shred-heavy metal riffs. Carrying this ethos forward, the AZ line embodies time-tested Ibanez innovation and player-focused features like a smooth, 
                oval neck grip, a well-balanced asymmetrical body shape, and the neck heel allowing for unrivaled playability.
